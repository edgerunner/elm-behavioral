# Itravel's coding challenge for Elm

## How

This repo is just fresh `elm init` and README. Please fork it and to submit the challenge create a PR with your solution.
For running it use whatever you want (it can be just an `elm reactor`).

## What 

### Tic Tac Toe
Build a Tic Tac Toe game in Elm that allows two players to play against each other (locally, on the same PC).
The game should include:
- starting screen (where you press Play)
- game board - 3x3 grid of squares
- display who's turn it is
- display who has won
- rematch button

The looks are up to you.

#### Bonus features
If you feel like it you can add some of the following:

- make the display of who has won nice looking/fancy (design is your choice)
- make it possible to select the size of grid on the starting screen (smallest is 3x3, but you can choose any n x n higher than that)
- persist game state between refreshes
